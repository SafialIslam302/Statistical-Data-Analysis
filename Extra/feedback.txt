The lecture class was fine but the exercise was horrible. 
The marking policy in the assignment was very poor. If she does not like the exercise or not according to the lecture note she gave direct zero. 
No partial marking schema is not shown. She told "No bonus point system on assignments" but she gave bonus points to many groups. 
In the exercise, we submit both individual and group submissions. If we submit individually then why should we need to submit group submission? It is a completely stupid thing. 
Another point, we submit individual submissions but if we need individual feedbacks she did not give it. Once I mail her, her reply was, "I never accept any separate assignments submission. Please combine your individual idea throughout your group discussion." But if we did not submission individual files then she directly gave zero. Basically, she ran the exercise class, by her own rules. 
Please change this assignment schema. Either submit group assignments or individual assignments.
